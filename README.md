# 这里是柒梦染星河！

仰望漫天星辰的梦

成为繁星中的一点

梦染群星，终抵彼方

**很高兴见到你，祝你开心！/ Nice to meet you! Wishing you lots of happiness!**

- About Name
  
my name is `柒梦染星河`, You can pronounce it like `qī mèng rǎn xīng hé` in Pinyin. So excited to meet you all!

 If you're unsure how to say them, you can just ignore the tones and say `qi meng ran xing he` instead. You can also call me `qiMeng`.

My username `qiMengStars` can also be my English name. (It doesn't matter whether there's an "s" or not)


- About Language
  
My English isn't perfect, so I often use translation tools. 
    
Thanks for bearing with me!
